I made this script to tweet my current internet speed at my ISP
That shit was like 1/6 of the speed that I pay for

I personally used the script with crontab to automate the job every hour

I removed the specifics of the tweet and my private twitter auth keys

Feel free to modify and distribute the code as you see fit.
